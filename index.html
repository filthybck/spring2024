<p>How did you become interested in Web Design?  I have had a certain insatiable obsession with computers and the internet in general since the days of using dial-up to get on AOL, and looking at the source code of HTML (I think I managed the right terminology here!) has intrigued me as much as confused me even so long ago, at such a young age.  I remember a certain website that was sort of a simplified way of making your own page, I want to say it was maybe called something like angelfire?  Anywho, I remember attempting at putting together a page without much direction even way back then, which then eventually evolved into my Myspace profile as that was the big thing at that point in time, which if I am not mistaken, incorporated HTML into formatting your customizable page(utilizing the all powerful copy+paste to harness someone elses code, if I remember correctly) Now here we are in 2024, and I am stoked to hopefully be able to officially learn some of the magic behind real web design!</p>
<p>What podcasts are you listening to?I am an avid listener of Mr. Ballen's strange dark and mysterious told in story format(I may have goofed the official name of the podcast here)  and I also really enjoy Darknet Diaries.  I believe these are both podcasts even though I just consume the content off of Youtube currently.  But just about anything true crime is right up my alley!  (This makes me feel like I should maybe mention that I definitely abhor all forms of violence and the like, I just like to explore and learn about many wildly different topics, just out of curiosity, i suppose!)</p>
<p>My current music taste is actually a bit peculiar for me, as I have recently been obsessed with the band Coheed and Cambria, even though my usual tastes generally lean more towards fairly heavy drill rap.  As for Coheed and Cambria, I definitely recommend anyone to listen, and hold them in a very high regard as far as quality music goes.  However the drill rap I would probably say, definitely not for everyone!</p>
<p>Career goals are to be a graphic designer, either freelance or working for a company, my next and more ambitious aim would be as a tattoo artist, and then past that lies my true holy grail, that I want to grow up and be an astronaut! (kidding, kinda?)</p>
<p>Artist who inspires me would have to be the graffiti legend, Banksy. I feel that answer needs no explanation!</p>
<p>Looking forward to this class, and eager to learn this subject with some great people and a great instructor!</p>
